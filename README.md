# StreamNest 

Welcome to **StreamNest**â€”my **first full-stack MERN project**. StreamNest is a fully functional video streaming platform where users can upload, view, and interact with video content. Built over the course of a month, StreamNest integrates modern web technologies to deliver a seamless user experience. I reworked on this project after some 6 months and changed the theme, fixed bugs, added premium features and much more.

## âœ¨Features

- **User Authentication**: Secure user login and registration using JSON Web Tokens (JWT).
- **Video Upload**: Upload videos with associated metadata like title, description, and thumbnail images.
- **Video Streaming**: Stream videos directly within the application with customizable quality settings.
- **Comment System**: Users can add, edit, and delete comments on videos.
- **Like & Subscribe**: Users can like videos and subscribe to channels.
- **Watch History**: Automatically track and display the user's watch history.
- **Playlist Management**: Create, edit, and delete playlists for organizing videos.
- **Premium Features**: Have exclusive videos and playlists to generate revenue.

## Tech Stack

## Challenges & Learnings

Building **StreamNest** was both challenging and rewarding. Some key learnings include:

- **Authentication**: Implementing secure authentication using JWT was a significant learning curve.
- **File Handling**: Integrating Cloudinary for handling large video files and generating optimized thumbnails was both interesting and challenging.
- **Responsive Design**: Tailwind CSS proved to be an excellent choice for building responsive interfaces quickly.
- **State Management**: Managing complex states in React, especially with asynchronous data, required careful planning and effective use of hooks.

## Todo todo
- Other videos from this channel (copy channel vids to get top 5 vids, get limited data, display)
- Error handling
    - Replace ApiError with ApiResponse
    - Replace try-catch with individual then-catch
    - Display error data
